# Minimal ASCII Character Generator for BX and OSE

If you're like me then you generate a lot of level 1 characters because they keep dying.

`chargen` is a Character Generator for BX/OSE that outputs the result in a one page print-friendly character sheet. I wanted to capture a similar look as the old-school character sheets made using a typewriter.

The inventory is randomly generated using rules from Necrotic Gnome's Carcass Crawler #2.

The class is randomly picked while optimizing for the highest prime requisite XP bonus.
